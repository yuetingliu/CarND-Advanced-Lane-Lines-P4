    "**Advanced Lane Finding Project**\n",
    "\n",
    "The goals / steps of this project are the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Compute the camera calibration matrix and distortion coefficients given a set of chessboard images.\n",
    "* Apply a distortion correction to raw images.\n",
    "* Use color transforms, gradients, etc., to create a thresholded binary image.\n",
    "* Apply a perspective transform to rectify binary image (\"birds-eye view\").\n",
    "* Detect lane pixels and fit to find the lane boundary.\n",
    "* Determine the curvature of the lane and vehicle position with respect to center.\n",
    "* Warp the detected lane boundaries back onto the original image.\n",
    "* Output visual display of the lane boundaries and numerical estimation of lane curvature and vehicle position.\n",

    "## [Rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/571/view) Points\n",
    "\n",
    "### Here I will consider the rubric points individually and describe how I addressed each point in my implementation.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Camera Calibration\n",
    "\n",
    "####  Comput the camera matrix and distortion coefficients\n",
    "\n",
    "The code for this step is contained in the second code cell of the IPython notebook located in \"./examples/example.ipynb\"   \n",
    "\n",
    "I start by preparing \"object points\", which will be the (x, y, z) coordinates of the chessboard corners in the world. Here I am assuming the chessboard is fixed on the (x, y) plane at z=0, such that the object points are the same for each calibration image.  Thus, `objp` is just a replicated array of coordinates, and `objpoints` will be appended with a copy of it every time I successfully detect all chessboard corners in a test image.  `imgpoints` will be appended with the (x, y) pixel position of each of the corners in the image plane with each successful chessboard detection.  \n",
    "\n",
    "I then used the output `objpoints` and `imgpoints` to compute the camera calibration and distortion coefficients using the `cv2.calibrateCamera()` function.  I applied this distortion correction to the test image using the `cv2.undistort()` function and obtained this result: \n",

    "### Pipeline (single images)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Undistort images\n",
    "\n",
    "To demonstrate this step, I will describe how I apply the distortion correction to one of the test images like this one:\n",
    "![alt text][image2]\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Filter the lane line points with HSV color thresholds\n",
    "\n",
    "I used pure color filters to generate a binary image. After some trial and error, I found the HSV's V channel to be the best color filters for both yellow and white lane lines. Besides, it seems LAB B channel and HLS L channel are both helpful \n",
    "\n",
    "![alt text][image3]\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. Transform perspective to get bird view of the lane line\n",
    "\n",
    "The transform_perspective function takes source (`src`) and destination (`dst`) points, returning both matrix inverse matrix for perspective transform and transform back later. I chose the hardcode the source and destination points in the following manner:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This resulted in the following source and destination points:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Source        | Destination   | \n",
    "|:-------------:|:-------------:| \n",
    "| 215, 705      | 350, 720    | \n",

    "| 1098, 705     | 950, 720    |\n",
    "\n",
    "I verified that my perspective transform was working as expected by drawing the `src` and `dst` points onto a test image and its warped counterpart to verify that the lines appear parallel in the warped image.\n",

    "\n",
    "#### 4. Identify lane-line points and fit their positions with 2nd order polynomial\n",
    "\n",
    "Then I did some other stuff and fit my lane lines with a 2nd order polynomial kinda like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "![alt text][image5]\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 5. Calculate the radius of curvature of the lane and the position of the vehicle with respect to center.\n",
    "\n",
    "Calculate the radius of curvature of the lane line as described in this [tutorial](http://www.intmath.com/applications-differentiation/8-radius-curvature.php). The position is calculated as the offset of the car center from the image center, suppose the camera is mounted at the center of the car.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 6. Plot back down onto the road such that the lane area is identified clearly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Draw the lane line with the found lane line points and the polynomial coefficients. After drawing, transform the image back to original view and stack with the original image. Here is an example of my result on a test image:\n",

    "### Pipeline (video)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Provide a link to your final video output.  Your pipeline should perform reasonably well on the entire project video (wobbly lines are ok but no catastrophic failures that would cause the car to drive off the road!).\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a [link to my video result](./project_video_output.mp4)\n",

    "### Discussion\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Briefly discuss any problems / issues you faced in your implementation of this project.  Where will your pipeline likely fail?  What could you do to make it more robust?\n",
    "\n",
    "Here I'll talk about the approach I took, what techniques I used, what worked and why, where the pipeline might fail and how I might improve it if I were going to pursue this project further.  "
